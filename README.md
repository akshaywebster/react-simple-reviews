## Reviews App Component

Simple Review Component written in React.js

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- React.js

### What I learned

With this project, I have got some great practice of useState. For the first time, I also used React Icons. There is also some good Vanilla JavaScript practice with the checkNumber(), nextPerson(), prevPerson() & randomPerson() functions. It's been a simple project since there was no usage of complex hooks like useEffect. The JSX structure has been pretty simple as well.
